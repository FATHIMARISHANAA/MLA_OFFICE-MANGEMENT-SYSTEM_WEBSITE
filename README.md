# MLA_OFFICE-MANGEMENT-SYSTEM_WEBSITE
The MLA Office Management System is a comprehensive digital platform designed to modernize and streamline legislative office operations by replacing traditional paper-based processes with an efficient digital solution. This role-based system caters to three primary user categories—Administrators, Personal Assistants (PAs), and General Users—facilitating attendance tracking, schedule management, project monitoring, and public grievance redressal. By digitizing critical governance functions, the platform enhances office efficiency while building public trust through improved transparency and accountability.

The system enables Personal Assistants to manage MLA attendance records, schedules, projects, events, and schemes, while Administrators oversee verification processes to ensure data integrity. Citizens can register accounts to access services, view MLA activities, submit complaints, and provide feedback on ongoing initiatives. Key features include a comprehensive complaint management system with progress tracking, media management for digital galleries and bulletins, review mechanisms for public feedback, and notification systems that keep all stakeholders informed about important developments.

By implementing this digital solution, MLA offices can significantly reduce paperwork, minimize manual errors, improve service delivery times, and foster greater public engagement. The platform serves as a model for e-governance initiatives, demonstrating how technology can enhance democratic processes and strengthen relationships between elected representatives and their constituents. Through improved accessibility, transparency, and operational efficiency, the system transforms traditional legislative office management into a modern, citizen-centric governance model.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
